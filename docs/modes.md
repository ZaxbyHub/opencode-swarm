# Execution Modes

Swarm has two orthogonal mode systems:

- **Session modes** (Turbo, Full-Auto) — toggled per-session via `/swarm turbo` and `/swarm full-auto`.
- **Project modes** (`execution_mode`) — set in config; controls hook overhead project-wide.

They compose independently. You can run `execution_mode: "strict"` with Turbo on, or `execution_mode: "balanced"` with Full-Auto on.

---

## Session Modes

### Balanced (default)

All QA gates run normally. Every task passes through reviewer + test_engineer before the architect marks it complete. This is the default when no session mode is set.

### Turbo

Skips Stage B (reviewer + test_engineer) for low-risk tasks. The task still goes through automated gates (syntax, placeholder, SAST), just not human-level review.

**Turbo does NOT skip Tier 3 files.** Security-sensitive paths always run full review, even when Turbo is on:

- `architect*.ts`, `delegation*.ts`, `guardrails*.ts`, `adversarial*.ts`, `sanitiz*.ts`
- `auth*`, `permission*`, `crypto*`, `secret*`, `security*.ts`

This list is enforced at `src/tools/update-task-status.ts:98-109`. You cannot turn it off.

**When to use:** rapid iteration on non-critical code — UI tweaks, documentation, internal refactors.

**Toggle:**

```bash
/swarm turbo on
/swarm turbo off
/swarm turbo          # toggle
```

Session-scoped. Resets when you start a new session.

### Full-Auto

Full-Auto is opencode-swarm's autonomy control plane. It reduces approval friction by deterministically allowing safe operations and routing ambiguous or high-risk operations through the read-only `critic_oversight` agent before they execute. Unlike Turbo (which bypasses Stage B for non-Tier-3 files), Full-Auto adds a *new* decision layer on top of every existing guardrail.

**First-class toggle.** Full-Auto is enabled and disabled at will from the session — no config-level enablement is required:

```text
/swarm full-auto on              # activate (supervised mode by default)
/swarm full-auto on strict       # activate with a mode override for this run
/swarm full-auto off             # pause the run
/swarm full-auto status          # report the durable run state
/swarm full-auto                 # bare toggle
```

While active, the critic reviews escalations, phase boundaries, delegations, and architect questions on your behalf; only an `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN` verdict (or a pause/terminate condition) hands control back to you. `off` **disarms** the run (durable status `idle`) and returns the session to normal interactive operation; paused/terminated states are reserved for system-initiated halts (denial limits, critic verdicts) and fail-closed-block non-read-only tools until you re-enable. An optional mode after `on` (or a bare mode token) overrides `full_auto.mode` for the run and is what the permission classifier enforces.

Administrators can refuse runtime activation entirely with `full_auto.locked: true`. `locked` ORs across config levels — a repo's project config cannot override a user-level lock — and activation also fails closed when a config file exists but cannot be parsed (an unreadable lock is treated as "unknown", not "unlocked"). `off` and `status` always work. Note the difference from the old gate: `enabled: false` used to make the hooks permanent no-ops, while `locked` keeps them armed — a corrupt `.swarm/full-auto-state.json` still fail-closed-blocks non-read-only tools project-wide until restored or deleted (`/swarm full-auto status` reports this as `UNREADABLE`).

The legacy `full_auto.enabled` flag is deprecated as a gate — it no longer arms or disarms anything. The v2 hooks (permission, delegation, input probe, cadence, phase approval) are gated by the durable per-session run state; the legacy reactive intercept is gated by the in-memory session flag (with a deliberate any-session fallback for messages without a session ID).

All tuning still lives in config (every field optional):

```json
{
  "full_auto": {
    "locked": false,
    "mode": "supervised",
    "fail_closed": true,
    "max_interactions_per_phase": 50,
    "deadlock_threshold": 3,
    "escalation_mode": "pause",
    "permission_policy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "trusted_roots": ["."],
      "trusted_domains": [],
      "protected_paths": [".git", "package.json"],
      "allow_defaults": true
    },
    "denials": {
      "max_consecutive": 3,
      "max_total": 20,
      "on_limit": "pause"
    },
    "oversight": {
      "on_plan_change": true,
      "on_task_completion": false,
      "on_phase_boundary": true,
      "on_high_risk_action": true,
      "on_subagent_return_warning": true,
      "every_tool_calls": 25,
      "every_architect_turns": 5,
      "every_minutes": 20
    }
  }
}
```

> **Defaults note:** `locked` defaults to `false` (runtime toggle available). `permission_policy.protected_paths` has 20 defaults including `.github/workflows`, `.swarm/`, lockfiles, `CHANGELOG.md`, and guardrail paths; the two shown above are the minimal override.

#### Modes

- `assisted` — least invasive. The deterministic policy still runs, but
  task completion does not require critic verification.
- `supervised` (default) — the deterministic policy + critic escalation for
  ambiguous/high-risk actions. Phase boundaries always require critic approval.
- `strict` — like supervised, but every task completion also requires critic
  verification.

#### Permission policy

The deterministic classifier handles obvious cases without an LLM call:

- **Allow** — read-only swarm and search tools, evidence/status reads,
  in-scope writes by coder, plan/evidence pathless tools.
- **Deny** — writes outside the project root, writes outside declared coder
  scope, direct writes to `.git`, exfiltration-like network actions,
  destructive shell, production deploys/migrations/force-push, permission
  grants, secret access, attempts to disable Full-Auto.
- **Escalate to critic** — package.json / lockfile changes, plugin/build
  config touches, guardrail/delegation/plan-ledger/evidence/tool-registry
  changes, shell commands not in the deterministic safe set, web/network
  fetches to non-trusted domains, dependency mutations, Task delegations,
  `phase_complete`, `update_task_status(completed)` (strict mode), tool
  output injection followed by a risky action, repeated denials, plan
  mutation after approval.
- **Escalate to human** — irreversible external operations, production
  infrastructure changes, or critic verdicts of `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN`.

#### Deny-and-continue behavior

A denial is returned to the agent as a structured error so it can choose a
safer path (declare scope, switch to a read-only verification, ask for
approval). Denials accumulate against two thresholds:

- `denials.max_consecutive` (default 3) — pause when N consecutive denials
  occur without an allowed action in between.
- `denials.max_total` (default 20) — pause when the cumulative session
  denial count is reached.

`denials.on_limit` controls whether the run is paused or terminated.

#### Prompt-injection scanner

Tool output from `web_search`, `webfetch`, `fetch`, `doc_extract`, `doc_scan`,
`gitingest`, `extract_code_blocks`, `retrieve_summary`, `search`, `read`, and
`view` is inspected for instruction-override, system-role-override,
credential-request, exfiltration, guardrail-disable, and curl-pipe-shell
patterns. Detections write a `full_auto_input_warning` event and stash a
warning on the session. The next risky action (shell, network, secret-read)
escalates to the critic instead of using the deterministic policy.

#### Subagent outbound and return checks

- **Outbound** — Task delegation requires a registered subagent, declared
  scope (for coder), and triggers an advisory if the prompt mentions a
  protected path.
- **Return** — The result text is scanned for skipped tests, tool timeouts,
  scope changes, "instructions from external content", missing evidence,
  and out-of-scope file generation. Severe categories pause the run.

#### Critic escalation triggers

A critic dispatch happens for: tool actions classified as escalate, plan
mutation after approval, `phase_complete`, task completion (strict),
subagent-return warnings, periodic cadence (every N tool calls / architect
turns / minutes), and on near-limit consecutive denials.

#### Phase approval gate

When Full-Auto v2 is active, `phase_complete` requires an APPROVED
`full_auto_oversight` evidence record at
`.swarm/evidence/{phase}/full-auto-*.json`. Stale (>24h), missing, or
non-APPROVED records block. Turbo does NOT bypass this gate.

#### Fail-closed behavior

When `fail_closed: true` (default), the permission/oversight layer pauses
the run on any of: missing `opencodeClient`, critic dispatch failure,
unparseable critic response, severe subagent return warning, denial
threshold reached.

#### Recovery

Paused or terminated runs are durable in `.swarm/full-auto-state.json`. To
resume:

```bash
/swarm full-auto on    # creates a fresh running record for the session
```

Inspect the file to see `pauseReason` / `terminateReason` and the denial
history. Address the underlying cause before re-enabling.

#### Legacy v1 fields

`max_interactions_per_phase`, `deadlock_threshold`, `escalation_mode`, and
`critic_model` continue to control the reactive intercept that fires on
architect text patterns. v1 and v2 layers run together — v2 verdicts are
also mirrored from v1 dispatches when a durable run exists.

**When to use:** long-running phases you want to run unattended. Pair with
Balanced or Strict `execution_mode` for safety.

### Combining Modes

**Lean Turbo** composes with all session modes — it is a lane planning layer, not a mode toggle. It partitions tasks into parallel lanes when `turbo.lean` is configured in config, regardless of whether Turbo or Full-Auto is active.

**Turbo + Full-Auto** are independent. Both can be on simultaneously — Turbo bypasses Stage B gates for qualifying tasks, Full-Auto keeps the architect moving between tasks without prompting you.

---

## Project Modes (`execution_mode`)

Set in your project config (`.opencode/opencode-swarm.json`):

```json
{
  "execution_mode": "balanced"
}
```

Persistent. Controls hook overhead at session init.

### `strict`

Enables slop-detector and incremental-verify hooks. Maximum safety for security-sensitive projects or production deploys. Higher latency per message due to added validation passes.

### `balanced` (default)

Standard hooks. Appropriate for most projects.

### `fast`

Skips the compaction service. Use when you're hitting context pressure on short sessions and willing to trade summary fidelity for speed.

## v8 Parallel-First Execution (#1674)

v8 flips opencode-swarm's published core execution contract from serial-by-default
to **safe-concurrent-by-default for provably disjoint work**, with serial as the
automatic, gate-enforced fallback.

### How it works
- **New plans default to `parallelization_enabled: true`** (applied at
  `save_plan` time; existing plans are unchanged on upgrade — see the v8 release
  fragment for the migration guard).
- **The execution gate enforces disjointness inline.** On every coder dispatch,
  the delegation gate computes a pairwise file-conflict verdict over the active
  phase's pending tasks (via the same pure helper the `plan_conflict_check` tool
  exposes). Overlapping or unknown declared scopes → `parallelModeActive === false`
  → serial, automatically. No architect discretion required.
- **Worktree isolation is the safety net.** When the gate permits parallel
  dispatch, each coder runs in its own isolated git worktree; merge-back aborts
  preserve the worktree on conflict (`#1657` durable recovery records + orphan-
  cleanup exemption).

### `plan_conflict_check` (advisory tool, #1656)
The architect can call `plan_conflict_check` *before* attempting parallel
dispatch to inspect the conflict matrix and a suggested serialization order. It
is genuinely read-only (writes nothing); the gate independently recomputes the
same verdict at dispatch time. Use it to choose disjoint task groups and
understand why the gate will (or won't) permit parallelism.

### Recovery UX (#1657)
When a lane's merge-back fails, a durable recovery record is written under
`.swarm/recovery/`. `/swarm status` surfaces a "Preserved recovery worktrees"
section, and `cleanupOrphanedBranches` exempts recovery branches (fail-safe on
read error). Records auto-clear when the lane later merges back successfully.

### Opting out
- Per-plan: `execution_profile.parallelization_enabled: false` at `save_plan`.
- Globally: `worktree.policy: disabled` (disables worktree isolation entirely).

---

## QA Gate Reference

### `council_mode` (Per-Task Council)

When enabled, replaces per-task Stage B (reviewer + test_engineer) with the full 5-member council (critic, reviewer, sme, test_engineer, explorer). Stage A still runs. Requires `council.enabled: true` in config. Evidence is written to `.swarm/evidence/{taskId}.json` under `gates.council` and validated for verdict, quorum, and timestamp.

### `phase_council` (Phase-Level Council)

When enabled, a full 5-member council reviews all work in a phase holistically at `phase_complete` time. Additive to per-task gates. Evidence is written to `.swarm/evidence/{phase}/phase-council.json` and validated for verdict, quorum, timestamp, and phase number.

### `final_council` (Project-Level Final Council)

When enabled, the final phase cannot complete until the architect dispatches the full 5-member council (`critic`, `reviewer`, `sme`, `test_engineer`, `explorer`) — NOT the General Council — with completed-project context and calls `write_final_council_evidence` with their collected `CouncilMemberVerdict` objects. Evidence is written to `.swarm/evidence/final-council.json` and validated for approved verdict, plan binding, and quorum metadata. This is the full 5-member council (not General Council mode) and does not use `convene_general_council`.

## Lean Turbo Lane Planning Engine

Lean Turbo (`src/turbo/lean/`) partitions phase tasks into parallel lanes based on file-scope conflicts, enabling multiple coders to work concurrently on non-conflicting tasks.

### What Lean Turbo Is

Lean Turbo is a **lane planning execution strategy** — not a mode toggle — that partitions phase tasks into parallel lanes based on file-scope conflicts, enabling multiple coders to work concurrently on non-conflicting tasks. It composes with all session modes (Turbo, Full-Auto, Balanced).

Key characteristics:
- **Lane planning layer** — Lean Turbo runs on top of existing session modes; it does not replace them
- **Parallel coder execution** — multiple coders dispatched simultaneously, each working in their own declared-scope lane
- **File-conflict partitioning** — tasks assigned to lanes based on declared scopes and file conflict analysis
- **Config-driven** — enabled via `turbo.strategy: "lean"` in config; `/swarm turbo lean on` activates it for the session
- **Stage B model** — lane tasks skip per-task Stage B (reviewer + test_engineer); quality is enforced at phase-end via phase reviewer and critic gates. Degraded and serialized tasks retain full Stage B.

### Comparison with Standard Turbo

| Aspect | Standard Turbo | Lean Turbo |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Stage B | Skipped for non-Tier-3 files | Skipped for lane tasks; phase-end reviewer/critic as quality gate. Degraded/serialized tasks retain full Stage B |
| Coder execution | Single coder | Multiple coders in parallel lanes |
| Activation | `/swarm turbo on` (session toggle) | `turbo.strategy: "lean"` in config + `/swarm turbo lean on` |
| Scope handling | No scope analysis | Partitioned by file-conflict analysis |
| Degradation | N/A (single flow) | Degraded tasks fall back to standard serial flow |
| Full-Auto composition | Independent | Subject to Full-Auto permission policy; Full-Auto paused/terminated blocks lean runner |
| Tier 3 patterns | Respected | Respected |

### Composition with Full-Auto v2

Lean Turbo composes with Full-Auto v2 when both are active:

- **Lane dispatch** is subject to Full-Auto permission policy — coders must pass the deterministic classifier or get critic escalation before receiving work
- **Full-Auto paused/terminated** blocks the Lean Turbo runner — it will not dispatch new lanes until Full-Auto is resumed
- **Full-Auto phase approval** is required before `phase_complete` even when Lean Turbo evidence exists — the `full_auto_oversight` gate at `.swarm/evidence/{phase}/full-auto-*.json` must be APPROVED
- Both can be active simultaneously — Lean Turbo handles task parallelization while Full-Auto handles permission/escalation decisions

### Architecture

```
planLeanTurboLanes(directory, phaseNumber, plan, config, scopes?)
    ├── 1. Task extraction        → filter completed tasks
    ├── 2. Scope resolution      → declared scopes → scope files → files_touched fallback
    ├── 3. Risk classification    → global / protected / no-scope / invalid-scope / normal
    ├── 4. Topological sort      → Kahn's algorithm with fail-closed cycle handling
    └── 5. Lane assignment        → greedy conflict-free parallelization (max_parallel_coders lanes)
```

### Conflict Detection Rules

Two tasks conflict if they touch:

- **Same file** — identical paths
- **Parent/child directories** — e.g., `src/auth/` vs `src/auth/login.ts`
- **Global files** — `package.json`, lockfiles, barrel files (`src/index.ts`), build config — always degraded
- **Protected paths** — paths containing `auth`, `crypto`, `secret`, `security`, `.env`, etc. — degraded or serialized based on `degrade_on_risk`

### Risk Classification (`src/turbo/lean/risk.ts`)

| Category | Trigger | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| `global` | Touches a global file | Always degraded → `balanced` mode |
| `protected` | Touches a protected path | `degrade_on_risk` → degraded; else serialized |
| `invalid-scope` | Scope contains `..` traversal | Serialized |
| `no-scope` | `require_declared_scope: true` + no declared scope | Serialized |
| `normal` | Regular scoped files | Parallelized across lanes |

### Lane Assignment Algorithm

1. **Wave-based dependency ordering** — tasks are grouped into dependency waves; a task's dependencies must complete before it enters the queue
2. **Cross-lane dependency tracking** — if a task depends on another in a different lane, it is serialized until that dependency completes
3. **File claim tracking** — each lane tracks claimed files; a task with any claim conflict is degraded or serialized
4. **Cycle detection** — Kahn's algorithm detects dependency cycles; all tasks in a cycle are fail-closed to serialized

### Path Normalization

All paths are normalized to POSIX-style (forward slashes, no trailing slash, `.` segments collapsed) before conflict detection. Windows paths are lowercased for consistent cross-platform comparison.

### Key Types

```typescript
// src/turbo/lean/planner.ts
interface LeanTurboLanePlan {
  phase: number;
  planId: string;
  lanes: LeanTurboLane[];         // Parallel coder lanes
  degradedTasks: LeanTurboDegradedTask[]; // Tasks degraded to balanced
  serializedTasks: string[];       // Tasks forced sequential
  degradationSummary?: string;      // Human-readable when all degraded
  counters: LeanTurboCounters;
  crossLaneDependencies: Record<string, string[]>; // dep taskId → [other lane taskIds]
}

// src/turbo/lean/conflicts.ts
// DEFAULT_GLOBAL_FILES — 27 global files (package.json, lockfiles, barrels, build config)
// DEFAULT_PROTECTED_PATTERNS — 19 protected path patterns (auth, crypto, secret, .env, etc.)
// normalizePath(filePath) → POSIX path
// pathsConflict(path1, path2) → boolean (same file or parent/child)
// isGlobalFile(normalizedPath) → boolean
// isProtectedPath(normalizedPath) → boolean
// readTaskScopes(directory, taskId) → string[] | null (reads .swarm/scopes/scope-{taskId}.json)

// src/turbo/lean/worktree.ts
// provisionWorktree(laneId, branchName, baseBranch, config) → Promise<WorktreeResult>
// removeWorktree(laneId) → Promise<void>
// assertCleanWorkingTree() → void (throws if dirty)
// isCleanWorktree() → Promise<boolean>
// autoCommitDirty(message) → Promise<string> (returns commit hash)
// cleanUntrackedFiles() → Promise<void>

// src/turbo/lean/merge-back.ts
// getMergeStrategy(config) → 'merge' | 'rebase' | 'cherry-pick'
// mergeLaneBranch(laneId, strategy) → Promise<MergeSuccess | MergeFailure | MergeConflict>
// postMergeCleanup(laneId) → Promise<CleanupSuccess | CleanupFailure>
// handleMergeConflict(conflictInfo) → Promise<ConflictHandlingError | null>
// attemptMergeBackFromDirty(laneId, strategy) → Promise<DirtyMergeSuccess | DirtyMergeFailure | DirtyMergePartial>
// cleanupOrphanedBranches() → Promise<OrphanCleanupResult>
// startupOrphanRecovery() → Promise<StartupRecoveryResult>
```

### Commands

Lean Turbo is controlled via `/swarm turbo lean`:

```
/swarm turbo lean on      # enable Lean Turbo explicitly
/swarm turbo lean off     # disable Lean Turbo
/swarm turbo lean         # toggle Lean Turbo on/off
/swarm turbo status       # show detailed status including active lanes and degraded tasks
/swarm turbo on           # follows turbo.strategy config (lean when config says lean, otherwise standard)
/swarm turbo standard on  # force standard turbo (disables lean even if config says lean)
```

`/swarm turbo status` displays:
- Whether Lean Turbo is active and configured
- Number of active lanes and tasks per lane
- Degraded tasks with reasons (global file, protected path, no scope, invalid scope)
- `degradation_summary` when all tasks degraded

### Evidence and Phase Reviewer/Critic Requirements

Lane evidence is written to `.swarm/evidence/{phase}/lean-turbo/` per lane:
- Each lane writes its own evidence file (`lane-{n}.json`)
- Contains task IDs, assigned files, lane status, and completion state

Phase-level evidence is written to `.swarm/evidence/{phase}/lean-turbo-phase.json`:
- Aggregates all lane outcomes
- Contains lane completion status and cross-lane dependency resolution
- Used by phase gates to verify lane completion

**Phase reviewer and phase critic** — when configured via `turbo.lean.phase_reviewer` and `turbo.lean.phase_critic`:

- **Phase reviewer** — dispatched with combined phase diff; read-only verification that all lane tasks are complete and consistent
- **Phase critic** — dispatched with boundary review; read-only verification of lane phase boundaries and cross-lane dependencies
- Both are **required** at `phase_complete` when configured — absence blocks the phase gate
- These serve as the holistic quality gate for lane tasks (which skip per-task Stage B). Degraded and serialized tasks still get individual Stage B.

### Recovery from Paused/Blocked

Paused or terminated Lean Turbo runs are durable in `.swarm/turbo-state.json`. To resume:

```bash
/swarm turbo lean on    # creates a fresh running record for the session
```

Inspect the file to see:
- `pauseReason` / `status` — why the run is paused or terminated
- `degradedTasks` — tasks that fell back to serial flow
- Denial history if Full-Auto integration is active

**Degraded tasks** — when Lean Turbo cannot place a task in a parallel lane, it falls back to standard serial flow:
- Degradation reasons: global file conflict, protected path, unknown scope, invalid scope
- Degraded tasks do **NOT** get Lean Turbo lane bypass — they run full Stage B gates (reviewer + test_engineer)
- `degradation_summary` shown in status when all tasks degraded

**Full-Auto blocking** — Full-Auto state can block the Lean Turbo runner:
- Full-Auto paused or terminated prevents new lane dispatches
- Check `/swarm full-auto status` to diagnose
- Resume Full-Auto first with `/swarm full-auto on`, then re-enable Lean Turbo if needed

### Configuration

Lean Turbo is configured via `turbo` and `turbo.lean` in `.opencode/opencode-swarm.json`:

```json
{
  "turbo": {
    "strategy": "lean",
    "lean": {
      "max_parallel_coders": 4,
      "require_declared_scope": true,
      "conflict_policy": "serialize",
      "degrade_on_risk": true,
      "phase_reviewer": true,
      "phase_critic": true,
      "integrated_diff_required": true,
      "allow_docs_only_without_reviewer": false,
      "worktree_isolation": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `strategy` | `"standard"` | `"lean"` enables Lean Turbo lane planning; `"standard"` uses single-coder Turbo |
| `max_parallel_coders` | `4` | Maximum concurrent coder lanes (1–6) |
| `require_declared_scope` | `true` | Fail-closed on tasks without declared scope |
| `conflict_policy` | `"serialize"` | `"serialize"` → sequential for conflicting tasks; `"degrade"` → switch to balanced |
| `degrade_on_risk` | `true` | Protected-path tasks degraded to balanced (`true`) or serialized (`false`) |
| `phase_reviewer` | `true` | Dispatch phase reviewer at `phase_complete` (read-only diff verification) |
| `phase_critic` | `true` | Dispatch phase critic at `phase_complete` (read-only boundary review) |
| `integrated_diff_required` | `true` | Require integrated diff for lane evidence |
| `allow_docs_only_without_reviewer` | `false` | Allow docs-only phases when reviewer is not available |
| `worktree_isolation` | `true` | Use worktree isolation for parallel coders |

> ⚠️ **Behavior change (FR-107 / SC-121):** `worktree_isolation` now defaults to `true`. Lean Turbo phases provision per-lane worktrees by default. To retain the previous behavior, set `turbo.lean.worktree_isolation: false` explicitly.

### Tests

111 tests covering: lane partitioning, conflict detection, parent/child path resolution, global file classification, protected path matching, cycle detection, cross-lane dependencies, scope resolution priority, Windows path normalization, and degradation summaries.

## Runtime Isolation (FR-201 – FR-206)

Per-lane environment isolation that prevents port collisions, cache contamination, and temp-directory conflicts when Lean Turbo lanes run concurrently.

### What is the Lane Runtime Profile

Each lane can receive a **lane runtime profile** — a set of derived environment variables written to `.swarm/lanes/{laneIndex}.env` (KEY=VAL format) inside the worktree root. Any child process spawned inside the lane can source this file to get lane-specific overrides.

The profile is produced by `computeLaneRuntimeProfile()` (`src/turbo/lean/worktree.ts` and `src/hooks/delegation-gate/worktree-isolation.ts`) from the resolved `runtime_isolation` config.

**Precedence (last write wins):**

1. **Derived PORT** — `PORT = port_base + laneIndex * port_stride` when `port_base` is explicitly set (no default)
2. **env_overrides** — explicit caller values win over derived PORT
3. **cache_redirects** — explicit cache redirect wins (last write wins)

`cache_redirects` keys must be valid env var names; values have `/lane-{laneIndex}` appended as a suffix to the configured base path using **platform-native path separators** (Windows: `\`, POSIX: `/`). The `.swarm/lanes/{n}.env` file itself always uses `KEY=VAL\n` format consumed by cross-platform tools. (e.g. `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/home/user/.cache → /home/user/.cache/lane-1` on POSIX; `TEMP=C:\Users\test\Temp\cache → C:\Users\test\Temp\cache\lane-1` on Windows)

### Default Behavior (Disabled by Default)

`runtime_isolation.enabled` defaults to `false` in both `turbo.lean` and `worktree` config blocks. When disabled, no profile is written and no environment changes are injected — **zero behavior change** for existing setups.

SC-129 / SC-130 encode this off-by-default guarantee: the integration test `cross-process-port-binding.test.ts` verifies that a disabled `runtime_isolation` produces no `PORT` injection.

### When to Enable

Enable `runtime_isolation` when:

- **Parallel lanes run port-binding servers** — each lane gets an isolated `PORT` to prevent collision (SC-122).
- **Integration test suites** need lane-scoped `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `TMPDIR`, or `XDG_CACHE_HOME`.
- **Dev servers** run per-lane and need isolated temp directories that are auto-cleaned on teardown.
- **Cache isolation** is required — redirect `~/.cache` or similar to per-lane directories.

### Cross-Platform Parity

| Platform | Sandbox mechanism | Soft-fail behavior |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Linux | `bwrap` (bubblewrap) | If `bwrap` is unavailable, falls back to env var + port injection only |
| macOS | `sandbox-exec` | If `sandbox-exec` is unavailable, falls back to env var + port injection only |
| Windows | Windows native-runner ({mode}: restricted-token / app-container) with `powershell wrapper` fallback | If sandbox preparation fails, falls back to env var + port injection only |

All three platforms **soft-fail** — if the OS-level sandbox envelope cannot be prepared, the lane still starts with env/port isolation only. A lane is never hard-failed due to sandbox unavailability (SC-132).

The executor mechanism is detected at runtime and reported by `/swarm diagnose` under the Sandbox health-check line.

### Common Scenarios

#### Two lanes running port-binding test servers

Lane 0 gets `PORT=41000`, lane 1 gets `PORT=41010` (with `port_base=41000, port_stride=10`). Both test servers start without a collision. `port_base` must be explicitly set — there is no default; if omitted, no `PORT` is injected.

```
// turbo.lean or worktree.runtime_isolation config:
{
  "runtime_isolation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port_base": 41000,
    "port_stride": 10
  }
}
```

#### Lane-scoped environment variables

Override `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `TMPDIR`, or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` per lane:

```json
{
  "runtime_isolation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "env_overrides": {
      "TEST_DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/test_lane_A",
      "TMPDIR": "/lane-tmp/lane-A",
      "XDG_CACHE_HOME": "/lane-cache/lane-A"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Values are copied verbatim — no `${LANE_INDEX}` template substitution is performed. To get unique values per lane, inject them via the dispatch layer before the lane is provisioned.

#### Lane-scoped cache and temp directories

Redirect cache paths to per-lane directories. The env file (`.swarm/lanes/{laneIndex}.env`) is removed at teardown, but the cache/temp directories referenced by `cache_redirects` are **not automatically deleted** unless they are inside the worktree that gets removed. External paths (e.g. `/lane-cache`) persist after teardown and must be cleaned up by the caller.

```json
{
  "runtime_isolation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "cache_redirects": {
      "XDG_CACHE_HOME": "/lane-cache",
      "TMPDIR": "/lane-tmp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration

```json
{
  "turbo": {
    "strategy": "lean",
    "lean": {
      "runtime_isolation": {
        "enabled": true,
        "port_base": 41000,
        "port_stride": 10,
        "env_overrides": {},
        "cache_redirects": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch — off by default for zero behavior change |
| `port_base` | _(none — no PORT injection)_ | Base port for lane 0; each subsequent lane gets `port_base + laneIndex * port_stride`. Must be explicitly set to enable PORT injection. |
| `port_stride` | `1` | Port increment between lanes |
| `env_overrides` | `{}` | Environment variable overrides applied to every lane |
| `cache_redirects` | `{}` | Cache path redirects for lane isolation |

The same fields are also available under `worktree.runtime_isolation` with identical semantics.

## Epic Mode (preview)

> **Status: opt-in, off by default.** Epic Mode is an optional execution mode that augments Lean Turbo with autonomous, coupling-aware lane planning. All four capabilities (A — co-change conflict, B — coupling report, C — activation gate, D — self-calibration) are wired: the `/swarm epic` and `/swarm coupling` commands, the `epic_decide_phase` / `epic_plan_waves` / `epic_record_divergence` tools, and the `EPIC_MODE_BANNER` are registered. With `turbo.epic.*` at defaults nothing runs and behavior is identical to Lean Turbo alone — the mode activates only after `/swarm epic on` (or `/swarm turbo epic on`).
>
> **Worktree-isolation interaction:** when Epic dispatches coders into isolated git worktrees, a coder whose merge-back fails leaves its work stranded outside the main tree. Epic's Rule 2 auto-commit detects this and skips the `swarm(task <id>):` completion marker so Rule 3 never treats an unmerged task as satisfied; the plan status still advances (the ledger is authoritative) and the failure is surfaced for recovery.

### What Epic Mode Is

Epic Mode composes Lean Turbo without modifying it. Where Lean Turbo asks *"how do I run these tasks in parallel safely?"*, Epic Mode adds *"should this work be parallel at all, and what is making it serial?"* — by measuring coupling from git history in addition to file paths.

The dependency direction is strictly one-way: Epic Mode depends on Lean Turbo; Lean Turbo never depends on Epic Mode. No file under `src/turbo/lean/` is modified.

### Capability A — Co-change-aware Pair Conflict

`src/turbo/epic/cochange-conflict.ts` exports `epicPairConflict(scopeA, scopeB, cochangePairs, threshold)` — a pure function that combines:

1. Lean Turbo's existing path-based pair test (`pathsConflict` from `src/turbo/lean/conflicts.ts`), and
2. A git co-change signal sourced from the existing `co_change_analyzer` tool, threshold-gated by NPMI and raw co-change count.

The combination is **conservative**: the co-change signal can only escalate a verdict from "no conflict" to "conflict". It can never downgrade a path-based conflict. The data source (`src/turbo/epic/cochange-source.ts`) caches per-project results keyed on `git HEAD`, with FIFO eviction at 10 directories, and falls back to "signal absent" (returning `[]`) on greenfield repos, non-git directories, or git errors — so a missing signal is never silently mistaken for "no conflict".

### Configuration

```json
{
  "turbo": {
    "epic": {
      "cochange": {
        "enabled": false,
        "threshold": 0.6,
        "min_co_changes": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `turbo.epic.cochange.enabled` | `false` | Master gate. With this off, no Epic-mode code runs. |
| `turbo.epic.cochange.threshold` | `0.6` | NPMI floor (range `[-1, 1]`) for a pair to contribute a co-change conflict signal. |
| `turbo.epic.cochange.min_co_changes` | `5` | Minimum raw co-change count required before NPMI is considered, to suppress small-sample noise. |

With `enabled: false` (the default), behavior is identical to before — verified by `tests/unit/turbo/epic/disabled-passthrough.test.ts`.

### Composition with Lean Turbo

Epic Mode imports — and **never modifies** — the following from Lean Turbo:

- `pathsConflict`, `normalizePath` from `src/turbo/lean/conflicts.ts`
- The output type of the existing `co_change_analyzer` tool (`src/tools/co-change-analyzer.ts`)

The `co_change_analyzer` is composed (not reimplemented) via its existing `_internals.parseGitLog` + `_internals.buildCoChangeMatrix` primitives, so Epic Mode benefits from any future analyzer improvements automatically.

### Capability B — Coupling KPI + decoupling roadmap

`/swarm coupling` is a **read-only diagnostic** that computes a coupling coefficient `p` for the current plan and ranks the modules that drive the most detected conflicts. It composes Capability A's conflict predicate over every task pair, so the report shows exactly what the future epic-mode planner *would* see if asked.

```
/swarm coupling                                # whole plan, markdown to stdout
/swarm coupling --phase 2                      # scope to phase 2
/swarm coupling --threshold 0.7                # what-if a stricter NPMI floor
/swarm coupling --min-co-changes 10            # what-if a stricter count floor
/swarm coupling --format json                  # machine-readable
/swarm coupling --persist                      # also write .swarm/epic/coupling-report.json
```

**Output structure.** A short header (`p = 0.NNN`, X conflicting pairs out of Y), a per-module contention table sorted by conflict count, a decoupling roadmap (top-5 modules with their share of detected coupling), and a conflicting-task-pairs table showing each pair's reason (`path` / `cochange` / `both`) plus evidence counts. All figures are explicitly framed as *estimates*, not measured production outcomes (per design rule §4.2 "quantitative claims are estimates").

**Independent of the runtime gate.** `/swarm coupling` runs whether or not `turbo.epic.cochange.enabled` is set. The config gate is for the *runtime* planner integration that ships later; the command itself is a what-if / diagnostic tool, useful before you opt the runtime in.

**Persists nothing by default.** With `--persist`, writes a structured JSON document to `.swarm/epic/coupling-report.json` via atomic `tmp + rename` (matching the lean-turbo state pattern), inside the project root.

### Capability C — Activation gate and the `epic` mode itself

The `epic` mode auto-decides parallel-vs-serial. When on, the architect runs the transparent decide-then-dispatch flow *instead of* `lean_turbo_run_phase(phase)`: it calls `epic_decide_phase(phase)`, which computes the coupling coefficient `p` over the whole plan (see [Per-plan, not per-phase](#per-plan-not-per-phase) below), gates on three independent checks, persists the decision to the evidence log, and returns a verdict that is either:


- **Promote** → the architect calls `epic_plan_waves(phase)` and dispatches each wave's tasks via the visible `Task` tool (concurrency the user can see), rather than the runner-internal `LeanTurboRunner` dispatch.
- **Demote** → a structured "serial" verdict so the architect falls back to the standard per-task serial path.

(The legacy unified `epic_run_phase` tool, which dispatched into `LeanTurboRunner` directly, is deprecated and not registered for the architect — the transparent `epic_decide_phase` → `epic_plan_waves` → `Task` flow superseded it so each coder appears as a visible subagent.)

#### The three gates (all must pass for promotion)

1. **p-threshold.** `p ≤ turbo.epic.mode.activation_threshold` (default `0.3`). Plans above this are deemed too coupled to parallelize safely.
2. **Hot-module.** No task in scope may touch a Lean Turbo global file (`package.json`, lockfiles, barrels, build config) or protected path (`auth/`, `crypto/`, `secret/`, `.env`, …). Reuses Lean Turbo's existing lists — no new list to maintain.
3. **Greenfield (brief §4.2 rule).** `commitsObserved ≥ turbo.epic.mode.min_commits_for_signal` (default `20`). A sparse co-change history is signal-absent — promotion needs positive evidence, not just absence of failure.

Default-serial-promote-on-proof: any failing gate forces `demote`. Promotion requires all three gates green.

#### Per-plan, not per-phase

The verdict is computed over the **entire plan's task graph** (every task across every phase), not just the phase being dispatched. The brief's "epic" vocabulary maps onto the codebase's one-plan-per-feature convention (a `Plan` is bound to a single `.swarm/spec.md` via `specMtime`/`specHash`), so per-plan activation IS per-epic activation. Lean Turbo's existing per-task degradation continues to operate inside each promoted phase — coupled tasks within an otherwise-promoted plan are still individually serialized by `planLeanTurboLanes`.

#### Slash command

```
/swarm epic on            # enable for this session
/swarm epic off           # disable
/swarm epic               # toggle
/swarm epic status        # show current state + last decision rationale
/swarm epic decide        # read-only what-if: show the verdict without dispatching
```

Toggling mutates session state, the durable `.swarm/epic-state.json`, and the in-memory `session.epicModeActive` flag. The system-enhancer hook reads that flag on every architect turn and injects an `EPIC_MODE_BANNER` into the prompt instructing the architect to use the `epic_decide_phase` → `epic_plan_waves` → `Task` flow instead of `lean_turbo_run_phase`.

You can also enable Epic Mode together with Lean Turbo via the unified turbo subcommand:

```
/swarm turbo epic on      # enables Lean Turbo + Epic Mode together
/swarm turbo epic off     # disables both
/swarm turbo epic         # toggles
```

`/swarm epic` remains as the epic-only toggle that does not also flip Lean Turbo session state (useful if a user wants the epic decision layer without Lean Turbo's session banners showing).

#### Configuration

```json
{
  "turbo": {
    "epic": {
      "mode": {
        "enabled": false,
        "activation_threshold": 0.3,
        "min_commits_for_signal": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `turbo.epic.mode.enabled` | `false` | Master gate. With this off, no Epic Mode code runs. |
| `turbo.epic.mode.activation_threshold` | `0.3` | Plan-wide `p` ceiling for promotion. Higher values relax the gate; lower values are more conservative. |
| `turbo.epic.mode.min_commits_for_signal` | `20` | Greenfield rule. Co-change history with fewer than this many commits is considered too sparse to trust. |

#### Promotion evidence

After every `epic_decide_phase` invocation, one JSON line is appended to `.swarm/evidence/epic-promotions.jsonl` with the timestamp, sessionID, phase, decision, `p`, gate rationale, and blocking reasons. This is the audit trail — never overwritten, only appended; tolerates partial-write of the trailing line.

### Capability D — Outcome-based self-calibration

Capability D closes the loop on Epic Mode's static knobs. After every task is marked `completed`, the architect calls a new tool `epic_record_divergence(directory, taskId, sessionID)` (the `EPIC_MODE_BANNER` auto-instructs it to). The tool compares the task's declared scope (`.swarm/scopes/scope-{taskId}.json`) against the files the coder actually modified (`session.modifiedFilesThisCoderTask`) and appends one line to `.swarm/epic/divergence.jsonl`.

On every subsequent `epic_decide_phase` call, the calibration engine consumes any new divergence records and updates two persisted knobs at `.swarm/epic/calibration.json`:

| Knob | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `activationThresholdOverride` | Tightens (toward zero) by `tighten_step` for every divergent task, capped at `floor_threshold`. Loosens (toward the static `activation_threshold`) by `loosen_step` only after `loosen_window` consecutive clean tasks; the counter resets on any divergent task and on every loosening event. |
| `hotModuleAdditions` | Files written without being declared get added permanently. **Monotonically grows** — never auto-shrinks. Loosening relaxes only the threshold; the hot-module list requires manual intervention to shrink. |

The calibration values plug into the same three gates Capability C already runs — they just supply tighter values when divergence has been observed. The static config is always the absolute ceiling: calibration can never relax past it.

#### `turbo.epic.calibration.*` knobs

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `turbo.epic.calibration.enabled` | `true` | Master gate for the calibration loop. With this off, the static `mode.activation_threshold` is always used. |
| `turbo.epic.calibration.floor_threshold` | `0.05` | Calibration never tightens the threshold below this. Below ~0.05 the gate becomes too strict to ever promote. |
| `turbo.epic.calibration.tighten_step` | `0.02` | Per-divergent-task tightening step. |
| `turbo.epic.calibration.loosen_step` | `0.01` | Per-loosening-event step (added toward the static config value). |
| `turbo.epic.calibration.loosen_window` | `10` | Consecutive clean tasks required before the engine loosens by `loosen_step`. |

#### Divergence-record format

Each line of `.swarm/epic/divergence.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-26T18:42:11.045Z",
  "sessionID": "sess-abc",
  "taskId": "T-1.2",
  "phaseNumber": 1,
  "declaredScope": ["src/a.ts"],
  "actualFiles": ["src/a.ts", "src/global.ts"],
  "undeclared": ["src/global.ts"],
  "unused": [],
  "divergenceRatio": 0.5,
  "isClean": false
}
```

Read-tolerant of partial-write of the trailing line. Best-effort writer — failures log but never block task completion.

## FAQ

**Why is the README's "Strict" mode not a session command?**  
The README table names three safety tiers for readability. In the code, the `execution_mode` config key is the persistent setting (`strict` / `balanced` / `fast`), and `/swarm turbo` is the session-scoped override. There is no `/swarm strict` command.

**Can Turbo break a security review?**  
No. Tier 3 patterns (`auth*`, `crypto*`, `security*.ts`, etc.) always run full review regardless of Turbo. See `src/tools/update-task-status.ts:98-109` for the authoritative list.

**Does Full-Auto bypass the critic?**  
No. Full-Auto v2 *increases* critic involvement: every escalate-class action gets a dedicated read-only critic verification before it executes, and phase boundaries require an APPROVED `full_auto_oversight` evidence record before `phase_complete` will succeed. Reactive intercept verdicts are also mirrored into the v2 evidence pipeline when a durable run is active. See `src/full-auto/oversight.ts` and `src/full-auto/phase-approval.ts` for the dispatch and gate.

**How does Lean Turbo avoid file conflicts?**  
The lane planner (`src/turbo/lean/planner.ts`) uses five conflict rules: exact-file match, parent/child directory containment, global file classification (package.json, barrels, lockfiles), protected path detection (auth, crypto, .env), and cross-lane dependency tracking. Tasks that can't be placed in a parallel lane are either serialized or degraded to balanced mode based on config. See the [Lean Turbo section](#lean-turbo-lane-planning-engine) for the full algorithm.

**How do I tell what mode is active?**  
`/swarm status` shows session modes. `/swarm config` shows the resolved `execution_mode`.

## Signal-Triggered Architect Modes (distinct from session modes)

The session/project modes above control *how* the swarm executes a plan. Separately, certain `/swarm` commands put the architect into a one-shot **signal-triggered workflow mode** by emitting a `[MODE: X ...]` activation signal that loads a dedicated skill on demand: `deep-dive` → `DEEP_DIVE`, `pr-review` → `PR_REVIEW`, `pr-feedback` → `PR_FEEDBACK`, `design-docs` → `DESIGN_DOCS`, `council` → `COUNCIL`, `issue` → `ISSUE_INGEST`, plus the spec-workflow modes (`specify`, `brainstorm`, `clarify`). These are not session modes and do not change `execution_mode`. See [Architecture Deep Dive — Signal-Triggered Modes](architecture.md#signal-triggered-modes-on-demand-skills) and the [Commands Reference](commands.md).
